        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 2009 by engineers Andy Langford and Tim Matyus, Matford began in a single Walsall unit.  
          Within six months we hired our first machinists and added extra CNC lathes; by year two we’d out-grown the site and doubled head-count.  
          Continuous investment—most notably our DMG Mori multi-axis line—now lets us compete head-to-head with Far-East pricing while keeping work here in the UK.

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          We machine prototype-to-medium volumes for OEM production lines, aftermarket bus & truck, water & gas utilities, automotive and agricultural equipment.  
          ISO 9001:2015 certified since 2011, our six DMG Mori NLX lathes cut multi-op parts in a single cycle—driving tighter tolerances, faster turnaround and keener cost.
