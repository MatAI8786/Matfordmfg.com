          <p>
            From quick-turn prototypes to small-batch production, Matford’s
            NLX-series turning centres take parts from raw bar to finished
            geometry in a single setup. Live-tool 4-axis milling, deep-hole
            drilling and tight in-house QC mean you get consistent accuracy —
            and a lead time counted in days, not weeks.
          </p>

            Need more than metal-cutting? We coordinate heat-treat (harden,
            temper, nitride), coatings (zinc, Geomet®, Xylan®) and full
            press-work or welded sub-assemblies&thinsp;— then bundle matched
            nuts, bolts and gaskets so every kit arrives production-ready at
            your door, anywhere in the UK.
